# Why this Bash Script ?

Sometimes I wish I would make it easier on myself to just create a script that I can refer to that would prep my Kali environment ready for CTF a lot quicker, especially when I am constantly tearing down VMs and re-creating them. After encounting some FAANG software engineering YouTube series, I realize that at some point I should learn to automate some of the mudane tasks.

This is my fun project to see what I can build out of my CTF toolkit
